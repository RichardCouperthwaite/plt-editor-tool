# plt-editor-tool

This module provides a GUI editor tool for editing the parameters of some basic matplotlib plots. The aim is to be able to modify the plotting parameters without going back to the root code and then to be able to save high quality publication ready plots.

The plt-editor-tool provides some of the functionality of the Matlab figure editor to the Matplotlib.pyplot system.

  - Easily change axis and title text and text properties
  - Manipulate data into plots in different grid layouts
  - Change line and marker colors and other parameters
  - Modify the properties of errorbars
  - Modify the properties of a fill_between plot
  - and more...

The plt-editor-tool is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/RichardCouperthwaite/plt-editor-tool)
 on GitHub.
